# 🚀 Chelsea Caputo | Elite Algo Trader Turned Solana Developer

Hi, I’m Chelsea — a professional algorithmic trader with 7+ years of experience mastering the markets, now transitioning into the bleeding edge of blockchain innovation. After dominating traditional markets with precision strategies, I’ve pivoted to building on Solana, specializing in high-performance DeFi bots powered by Rust smart contracts and Solana-native tooling.

## 👩‍💻 From Candlestick Charts to Smart Contracts

Before writing my first line of Rust, I made my name in the markets through disciplined, technical-based trading.

I specialize in:
- 📊 **Scalping using raw candlestick analysis**
- 🕓 **Mid-term trendline trading on the 4H time frame**

These strategies allowed me to consistently extract profits from both volatile and ranging markets — long before automation. My edge came from a refined understanding of market structure, precision timing, and price action.

Now, I’m channeling that same edge into building elite on-chain infrastructure for Solana — automating and scaling what once required hours of active screen time.
